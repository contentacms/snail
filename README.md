For decoupled applications you don't want to let url aliases change the Drupal
routing system. On the other hand you want to have path with all its goodnesses

* Generate path aliases automatically using pathauto
* Allowing to set paths manually

Based upon an idea from [@justafish](http://github.com/justafish) all this module is doing is to disable
any redirects, both inbound and outbound.
